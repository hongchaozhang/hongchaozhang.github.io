Turi介绍

Apple says Turi Create is easy to use, has a visual focus, is fast and scalable, and is flexible. Turi Create is designed to export models to Core ML for use in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps. From the Turi Create Github repository: 
* Easy-to-use: Focus on tasks instead of algorithms
* Visual: Built-in, streaming visualizations to explore your data
* Flexible: Supports text, images, audio, video and sensor data
* Fast and Scalable: Work with large datasets on a single machine
* Ready To Deploy: Export models to Core ML for use in iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS apps

With Turi Create, for example, developers can quickly build a feature that allows their app to recognize specific objects in images. Doing so takes just a few lines of code. 

Turi Create covers several common scenarios including 
* recommender systems
* image classification
* image similarity
* object detection
* activity classifier
* and text classifier.
