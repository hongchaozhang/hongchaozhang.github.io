[**updated 2015.09.13**] Github has two kind of pages: **user/orgnization pages** and **project pages (gh-pages)**.

Currently, I am using the **user/orgnization pages** deployed by [octopress](http://octopress.org/). This is recommended, due to the easy deployment.

If you are using the **project pages (gh-pages)**, the following references may be help.

### How to get started

Refer to "[一步步在GitHub上创建博客主页](http://www.pchou.info/web-build/2013/01/03/build-github-blog-page-01.html)".

### Categories and tags

I tried the [this](http://www.minddust.com/post/tags-and-categories-on-github-pages/) one. It works well.

### Jekyll debugging

I didn't try the [debugger](https://github.com/octopress/debugger) yet.
